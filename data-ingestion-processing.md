# Scalable data ingestion from device

Each LANSCAPE has its own Kafka Instance

## Kafka Topics (for each Project specific to a Tenant of a Landscape)

1. <PROJECT_ID>_device_raw_data (data sent to a Node.js REST api)
2. <PROJECT_ID>_to_cold_store (generated by an Node.js app based on device_raw_data - if events processing is active)
3. <PROJECT_ID>_to_event_processing (generated by an Node.js app based on device_raw_data - if events processing is active)

All topics with only 1 partition : partition 0 !

## Worker Apps

1. Node.js CF REST API as backend (optional) that writes data to <PROJECT_ID>_device_raw_data topic

2. Node.Js worker app that reads the <PROJECT_ID>_to_cold_store topic save messages to cold store

3. Node.Js worker app that reads the <PROJECT_ID>_to_event_processing topic and check with the rules engine for events if functionalities are enabled
